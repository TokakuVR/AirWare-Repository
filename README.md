# AirWare-Repository

This is the Official Airware repository!

This is used to import your game into the database.

Your game may be free or paid within the Meta quest store.

All you need is a computer that supports wireless ADB via wifi, a APK and OBB of the game installed on your headset, and a windows PC

This build is still in development.

THIS IS NOT THE FULL VERSION!!!

You cannot download other games because there would be no point in making this public on github

Buy the full version here
